# Analyze-Taylor-Swift-Lyrics-with-Python

### Project Description 

This project explores whether *Taylor Swift* had dropped any hints about her album "Midnights" before its release in 2022. As part of this, her lyrics have been analyzed to identify references to "midnight" leading up to the album, with the scope later expanded to include mentions of day, night, and time in general.

Additionally, *Sentiment analysis* has been used to study her tone and vibe throughout her career. Finally, the findings are combined to determine whether her lyrics depict day or night more favorably.
